  remsays: {
    world: "Panterra is not only a civilization - in its heart is a management system with ceremony painted over it. Study the structures. Ignore the decoration.",
    characters: "Everyone in this room has a function. Some of them know what it is. Pay attention to the ones who seem not to.",
    timeline: "The algorithm didn't begin in Year 271. That was just when we announced it. I would know.",
    map: "Parliament's borders are not geographic. They are jurisdictional. The land is just where the law stops being polite.",
    bestiary: "The things in here are not monsters, though they may look terrifying - and that matters more than you think.",
  },
  quinn: {
    world: "The Cornerstone Laws read differently in the original Levilian. I am one of perhaps four people alive who would know. The translation you have seen is not wrong. It is just not complete.",
    characters: "Scholarship requires you to hold two contradictory things at once and not collapse either of them. Most people find that uncomfortable. I find it the only honest way to live.",
    timeline: "The Language Purge of Year 134 removed more than dead texts. It removed the ability to verify anything written before it. That was not a coincidence.",
    map: "Sanctorium's holdings extend well beyond what is marked here. The archives alone occupy territory no Parliament map acknowledges.",
    bestiary: "The Ivory vaults contain records of things Panterra decided not to name. Naming gives them weight. The decision not to name them gave them something worse.",
  },
  thema: {
    world: "The Republic is very old and very tired and does not know it yet. I have watched younger things than this believe themselves permanent. They were not.",
    characters: "Everyone you see here has already made their most important choice. Most of them do not realize which one it was.",
    timeline: "I have presided over ceremonies in every era on this record. The ones that were not recorded were more interesting.",
    map: "Deep Forge predates every institution on this map. What is underneath it predates the Forge. I suggest you think carefully about what that means.",
    bestiary: "These are not cautionary tales. They are descriptions. There is a distinction the Republic has always preferred you not make.",
  },
  sailor: {
    world: "The parts of this they don't want you to read are the parts at the edges. Always the edges. I've lived out there. It's not empty.",
    characters: "I've met most of these people. Some of them in places they wouldn't want recorded. The ones who smile the most are the ones to watch.",
    timeline: "Official timelines always have the same shape - long stretches of calm, then a crisis, then resolution. They leave out everything that happened between the crisis and the resolution. That's where the real story is.",
    map: "The frontier isn't on this map. Neither is what lives there. I've drawn better ones on the back of a water ration slip. Ask me nicely and maybe I'll share.",
    bestiary: "I've encountered three of these. Only told anyone about one. The other two I'm keeping to myself until I understand them better.",
  },
  kotani: {
    world: "Panterra is a closed system. Closed systems do not sustain themselves indefinitely. I have known this for some time. I made my peace with it. I am still not certain that was the right decision.",
    characters: "Loss clarifies. Everyone here has lost something - most of them have not yet admitted what it was. Watch for the ones who have. They move differently.",
    timeline: "What transpired in Rockfall was not a warning. It was a preview. The difference matters if you are trying to prepare rather than repent.",
    map: "Canvas sits in the southwest. We are furthest from the center of power and closest to the edge of the known world. I have always believed that is significant.",
    bestiary: "After witnessing my first ceremony, I understood certain things I had not understood before. Here buries the outcome of the tragedies.",
  },
  norstrand: {
    world: "I have said the words of the ceremony ten thousand times. I still do not know if they are true. I have decided that the not-knowing is part of what they mean.",
    characters: "The people who build things - institutions, systems, legacies - always underestimate what those things will do once they outlive their builders. I am no exception.",
    timeline: "Ceremony outlasts belief. The Republic understood this from the beginning. It is the most sophisticated thing they ever did.",
    map: "Finnrare is in the northwest. I chose this. The northwest is where things end and begin again. I find that useful.",
    bestiary: "I built things I believed in. Some of those things are in here now. I am still deciding how to feel about that.",
  },
  culver: {
    world: "The ocean systems are more unstable than the public record indicates. I have the data. I have reported it. The report was classified the same week. That is when I started keeping a second copy.",
    characters: "Idealism is not the same as naivety. I have been told they are the same thing by people who needed me to believe that. I have stopped listening to them.",
    timeline: "The Ocean Accords of Year 89 set specific boundary coordinates with no public explanation. I found out why. I am still deciding what to do with that information.",
    map: "The Ocean Reaches are the most important territory on this map and the least governed. What I found there changes everything. I mean that without exaggeration.",
    bestiary: "Recovery is possible. For the ocean. For other things. The Republic's working assumption is that certain things cannot be recovered. The Republic is wrong.",
  },
  carmela: {
    world: "I served the institution before I understood it. Most people do. The understanding comes later, if it comes at all. What you do with the understanding is the only question that matters.",
    characters: "Proximity to power is not the same as power. I spent years learning that distinction. It cost more than I expected.",
    timeline: "The ceremonies I witnessed in the Ivory court do not match the official record of those same ceremonies. I kept notes. I should not have kept notes. I kept them anyway.",
    map: "The Sanctorium vaults are not on any map. The Sanctorium vaults are where everything that is not on any map is kept.",
    bestiary: "I have seen things in the inner courts that do not appear in any official bestiary, any census, any record. Whatever they were, the institution chose not to name them. I noticed.",
  },
  lockland: {
    world: "Every system contains the mechanism of its own undoing. The Republic's founders knew this. They built the undoing in deliberately. Whether that was mercy or arrogance I have never decided.",
    characters: "The people who love you are the ones you have to protect from yourself. I understood this too late to be useful.",
    timeline: "There are events in this timeline that I know more about than is recorded here. I am choosing not to add to them. Some things should stay where they are.",
    map: "The places that matter most are never on the official maps. They exist in the spaces between what is acknowledged. I spent my life in those spaces.",
    bestiary: "I was warned about one of these before I encountered it. The warning was accurate but incomplete. Most warnings are.",
  },
  aspen: {
    world: "The Magistry of Peace is not what its name suggests. I say this as its Director. Names in this Republic are chosen for what they make people believe, not for what they describe.",
    characters: "Everyone in a room trusts me. I have worked very hard to make that true. I am still deciding whether I deserve it.",
    timeline: "The expansion of the Unmarking Orders in Year 178 - the classified one - I have seen the expanded list. I wish I had not.",
    map: "The Northeast quadrant has the most institutional concentration of any region on this map. Power clusters. It always clusters. That is the first thing they teach you and the last thing you understand.",
    bestiary: "I was chosen for my position by someone who believed in me. I was used in that position by someone who believed in something else. The things in here were made the same way.",
  },
  wintry: {
    world: "The satellite network is not what Parliament's announcement described and not what Sanctorium's blessing consecrated. I know what it is. I have known for over ten years.",
    characters: "I built the infrastructure that makes most of these people's authority possible. None of them know that. I find that clarifying.",
    timeline: "The Satellite Expansion of Year 119 doubled the perimeter rather than the coverage density. I can tell you exactly why. I won't though, not yet.",
    map: "The boundary coordinates of the satellite network are set for a reason that has nothing to do with ultraviolet radiation. The reason is on this map if you know where to look. I suggest looking at what is outside the boundary, not inside it.",
    bestiary: "I know what happens after Apotheosis. It is not what the ceremony describes. I have not told anyone. I am telling you now only because you asked.",
  },
  cora: {
    world: "I sit in the rooms where Panterra's future is decided. I say very little in those rooms. Silence is not agreement. The Republic has always preferred to read it that way. I have allowed that preference to stand.",
    characters: "The people in this record are the ones the Republic has chosen to acknowledge. There are others. I know some of their names. I will not write them here.",
    timeline: "Every event on this timeline was a decision made by someone in a room. I have been in some of those rooms. The decisions were smaller and more frightened than the record suggests.",
    map: "What's marked Unknown is real. I know where it is. I know what it is for. I made a choice about that information a long time ago. I am still paying for it.",
    bestiary: "I love my children. I have made choices that contradict that love. The things in here were made by people who believed the same contradiction about themselves.",
  },
  gemma: {
    world: "The political structure of Panterra is elegant from a distance. Up close it is held together with threats and memory. I have been both the threat and the memory at different points in my career.",
    characters: "I have worked alongside, beneath, and occasionally against most of the people in this record. My assessments would not match the official ones. I consider that a credential.",
    timeline: "My rank was earned during an event that does not appear on this timeline. The event was real. The omission was deliberate. I was in the room when they decided to omit it.",
    map: "The Sanctorium's political reach extends into every quadrant on this map. It does not appear on maps because maps show territory. The Sanctorium's hold is not territorial. It is personal.",
    bestiary: "I have a scar. The scar marks something that happened during a ceremony. The ceremony is not in any official record. Whatever made this mark - it knew what it was doing.",
  },
  verlaine: {
    world: "I arrived in Panterra with a name that was not mine and a history that was not entirely fabricated. The parts that were real were the dangerous parts. I have spent considerable effort making sure no one knows which parts those were.",
    characters: "Identity in Panterra is whatever your semper scar says it is. I found that useful. Most people find it reassuring. We are looking at the same fact from different directions.",
    timeline: "The Language Purge of Year 134 destroyed documents that would have identified me. I did not arrange that. But I have been grateful for it every year since.",
    map: "The Ivory vaults contain records I cannot allow to be read. I have taken steps. The steps were sufficient - at least until today.",
    bestiary: "The Unmasked entry is the one I read most carefully. I read it to understand what I am not. I am not always certain the distinction holds.",
  },
  jude: {
    world: "I ran this Republic for longer than I intended. The systems work, even though I did not design them. The fact that they work does not mean they are right.",
    characters: "I chose my successor carefully. I chose them because they were good. I am no longer certain that goodness is the correct qualification for what the position requires.",
    timeline: "I knew about the Rockfall Event in advance. I decided who was told first. I made that decision in approximately four minutes. I have had considerably more time to think about it since.",
    map: "Parliament does not control Sanctorium. Parliament controls everything around Sanctorium. The distinction is in the paperwork. The paperwork is very carefully written.",
    bestiary: "Every entry in here is a consequence of a policy decision. I made some of those decisions. I am reviewing my position on several of them.",
  },
  soleil: {
    world: "Panterra is warmer than it looks from the official record. The people in it are trying. Most of them are genuinely trying. That is not nothing, even if it is also not enough.",
    characters: "I notice things. I have always noticed things. I was placed in my position partly because of that and partly despite it, depending on who you ask.",
    timeline: "The records I have accessed suggest the ocean recovery timeline is more optimistic than the private projections. I find myself hoping the public record is the accurate one. I am not certain it is.",
    map: "The Ocean Reaches are beautiful even now. I want you to know that. Whatever else is true about what is happening to them - they are still beautiful.",
    bestiary: "I have been in rooms that most people do not know exist. Some of what I found there belongs in here. I have not decided whether to say which.",
  },
